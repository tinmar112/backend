Welcome to this MASTERMIND game.


### Setting up the app.

Make sure Flask is installed on your computer. 
You can create a virtual environment with Flask and play the game through it.

Once flask is installed, go into the game folder and launch the app :
$ python app.py

This should prompt a message, telling you that it is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or a similar port).

Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser, and play!

Use Control-C to stop the server.


### Playing

You have to type in colour names in letters.
Right now, the winning combination is set to 'green, green, yellow, yellow'.

Here's how to interpret pegs (aka. indications) : if you get
'green blue green orange => => => red white'
this means that you got one red peg and one white peg.

Please refer to the game documentation available online if you don't understand pegs.
